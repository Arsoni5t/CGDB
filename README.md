**Welcome to the Cognitive Genetics Database**. 

Founded in 1992 at Bram College, the goal of our database is to track the decline of mental health through a series of questions targeting the sanity of the participant.

A shining beacon in the field of mental health testing, The CDGb program has been cited in over 217 journal articles (237 - including films). 

## How does it work?

We will start off the questionnaire by establishing a baseline sanity for each 'volunteer'. 

* Depending on the response, the questionnaire will adapt to and challenge the participant.

    *  Remember to answer truthfully, the doctors will be reviewing your results!

Our program has been refined for over 28 years, _there are no glitches or misteaks._

* _IF_ you find yourself having fun, you're doing something wrong.

## How it is made:

* The database will have an Auth to establish the starting sanity score of the user. 
* Questions will adapt to the user based on their current sanity score, which will increase or decrease through the exam.
* Animated JS/CSS are used to create challenges for the examinee.
* Sound elements can be incorporated for multi-sensory testing. 

_IF_ you find yourself struggling with any part of the questionnaire, remember, 
**it's all your mother's fault.**

Please answer all questions honestly... we will know if you are lying :-)

The only way through is forward, the only way back is through.

# Technologies and Technical Challenges


## Backend
- MongoDB
    - We'll be utilizing MongoDB for our database.  Its flexibility allows us to make changes to our basic schema as we like.
- Mongoose
    - Allows us to model our data the way we want.
- Express
    - Allows us to control what we send and receive from the backend

A record of our "volunteers" and questionnaires will be kept on our backend.

## Frontend
- React
- Node.js

Our frontend will be incharge of retreiving our volunteer's data and presenting them with a questionnaire.
Volunteer's sanity will also be tracked through our frontend.
